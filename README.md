## Overview
Katash Logic – The Bench-O-Meter is a personal home project designed to analyze
real-time momentum for basketball players and recommend when a player should rest
or stay on the court.

The system combines:
1. In-game performance (momentum)
2. Pre-game fitness levels and player roles (fitness score)

Inspired by Oded Katash’s flow-based coaching style.

## Project Goal
Build an FPGA-based system that receives basketball events as inputs, 
calculates momentum and fitness in real time, and outputs a substitution recommendation.

## 🚀 Hardware Bring-Up: First Basys3 Test Successful (10 Dec 2025)

Today the Basys3 FPGA board arrived, and the first on-board hardware validation was completed.

We implemented a simple **clock divider + LED blink** HDL design in VHDL, synthesized it in Vivado, generated a bitstream, and programmed the FPGA.

### 🔧 What was implemented
- **clock_divider.vhd** — divides the 100 MHz onboard oscillator down to 1 Hz  
- **top.vhd** — maps `CLK100MHZ`, `btnC`, and drives `LED[0]`  
- **Basys3.xdc** — correct pin assignments for clock, push button, and LED  

### 🎉 Result
LED0 on the Basys3 board blinks at ~1 Hz, confirming:

- HDL compilation ✔️  
- Constraint file correctness ✔️  
- Bitstream generation ✔️  
- JTAG communication ✔️  
- Real hardware execution ✔️  

This marks the **first hardware milestone** of the Bench-O-Meter project.
