# basketball-momentum-substitution-fpga
A real-time basketball momentum-based substitution system implemented on Basys3 FPGA.
# Basketball Momentum Substitution System (Basys3 FPGA)

Goal:
A simple home project that calculates real-time positive/negative momentum 
for basketball players and recommends when a player should rest or stay on the court 
based on in-game performance and pre-game fitness level.

Project Status:
Idea phase only. The Basys3 board has not arrived yet.

Planned Steps:
- Write an initial project specification
- Define the momentum calculation algorithm
- Create a basic architecture diagram
- Begin development once the Basys3 arrives

- ## Roadmap

- [x] Create GitHub repository  
- [x] Add initial README  
- [x] Add basic project specification (version 0)  
- [ ] Define initial momentum formula  
- [ ] Create architecture diagram  
- [ ] Design first FPGA modules (clock divider, input unit)  
- [ ] Start Basys3 experiments when board arrives  
- [ ] Build momentum calculator in VHDL  
- [ ] Add simulation testbench  
- [ ] Integrate modules into full system  
- [ ] Final testing on hardware
